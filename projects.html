          <h3>Sims 4 Activism Mod</h3>
          <p>
            Currently working on an activist mod for the Sims 4 where players
            can make their Sims fight for causes they believe in. So far I have
            been working on the underlying trait that the sims needs to have in
            order to play out activist scenarios - talking about socio-political
            issues or causes, trying to change an obstructionist's view, acting
            better than them and so on. Here are a few screenshots of how it's
            looking in the game.

          <h3>Covet Fashion Mod</h3>
          <p>
            Before starting on the Sims mod, I tried out a mod for another game,
            Covet Fashion. I wanted to make a sell system where the player could
            sell items of clothing they did not want anymore. This one was a of
            a flop in terms of its actual value in the game, but I was really
            happy with how far my coding skills came in this project.

            />
          </figure>
          <figcaption>
            The closet script contained dresses for selling examples. The
            dresses could be tried on, sold, their value subtracted from the
            players overall closet value, and the players cash increased.

            This is the UI of the mod. It made up of screenshot taken from the
            game itself as I wanted to creative a cohesive mod, not something
            that you could not picture in the game.

          <figcaption>
            The sell script was where I had the most fun. Creating the SellDress
            function required me to make sure my other scripts were set up well
            so that I could make a function that combatted redundancy -
            something that I REALLY need to work on.

          <h3>Heartsherf</h3>
          <p>
            Heartsherf was inpsired by Arrietty and was worked on by Jessica Hon
            and I last year. The player plays as Bo, a miniature human who is
            always accompanied by a friendly bee. Bo begins in the stores front
            and will first come across the granny NPC. Talking to the granny
            will give the player a chance to obtain an object from the granny
            that will help Bo when meeting the second NPC, Alex, in the
            courtyard. Being a good listener will help you with the granny and
            being sympathetic and generous will help you with Alex. Jess worked
            on the artwork side of the project while I worked on the coding and
            programming.
