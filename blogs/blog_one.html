      <h2 class="headings-two">McLuhan Reflection: Mediums as Messages</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        I feel that the McLuhan reading teaches us to think about how mediums
        become messages, how they influence those messages (in the methods a
        medium will use to communication a message), and possibly how those
        messages can even then become their own mediums. Mediums have social,
        political, economic, personal consequences - affecting our ideas of
        humanity. This reading made me think of Stuart Hall's systems of
        representation - how signifier and signified make up a sign and how
        these signs sometimes create a universal language, a message. Within
        this, mediums are signs which contain messages exclusive to the content
        of the medium. Adverts that appear on TV or radio indicate a message
        that the company can afford such an expense, possibly making them seem
        more reputable, as opposed to seeing a written advert in the classified
        section of a newspaper. There was a lot to unpack in the reading,
        hopefully we can briefly talk about it in next week's round table. But
        otherwise these were too comments that I thought I'd add to the
        discussion: His point on the American Revolution, that it "had no
        medieval legal institutions to discard or to root out, apart from
        monarchy", paired with his sentiment that England is yet to undergo
        their revolution, feels like it missed an opportunity to highlight the
        medieval legalities that the American Civil Rights movement aimed to
        root out. I know he's speaking on De Tocqueville's work and is focusing
        on technology but I feel this is important: The mediums of the movement,
        which I feel stretch all the way from posters to even schools (like in
        Little Rock), are such good examples of messages becoming mediums
        themselves. The protest at Little Rock Central Highschool can be
        encapsulated as a medium because it was a platform for white
        supremacists to spew their ideologies (their message), but the resulting
        message that came from their actions - black students being escorted by
        the military - became a medium for civil rights activists to further
        their message. I bring this up because McLuhan published this work in
        1964, several years in to the CRM - a legal, political and social
        revolution in my opinion.

      <p class="paragraph">
        The grammar of print cannot help to construe the message of oral and
        nonwritten culture and institutions" (page 4) - this made me think of a
        reading on orality and oral cultures and how we learned about it in
        relation to storytelling - a spoken story (at first a message) told by a
        storyteller (arguably the medium) becomes itself a medium within the
        listener's memory. Remembering and recalling the relevance of the story
        (or the even storyteller) would then translate into a message that is
        relevant for the listeners current activity (like if they were talking
        to someone about a story they once heard). I feel the same process would
        happen with a written and read story, just that the messages would have
        different results. What this reading ultimately made me think of is what
        messages my future games will hold depending on the medium they are
        played through. That the medium, as "any extension of ourselves", shows
        the impact of scenarios like using mouse and keyboard as opposed to a
        controller. GTA and Rocket League, to me, are 100% better experienced
        through using a controller. Maybe that comes from my personal background
        (it probably does), but it's the same as preferring Sims on PC rather
        than PS2 or mobile. With regards to Sims, PC and mobile versions are
        almost totally different games. And they have these vast differences
        because they are being played on different mediums which limit and allow
        for different types of gameplay - that would be a cool essay to dive
        into.
