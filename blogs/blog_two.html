      <h3 class="headings-three">Semantic Markup: What is it?</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Coding languages, like HTML in our case, make use of semantic markup as
        it involves the structuring of the code we write in order to focus on
        the code's content above all other qualities. The word semantic refers
        to meaning in language or logic and markup, in coding, refers to labels
        assigned to sections of text to indicate and declare their position in
        the text as a whole. Thus, semantic markup involves applying the methods
        of "markup" to the "semantics", the language used, in code. I understand
        semantic markup as grammar for code.
      </p>
      <h3 class="headings-three">Why is it necessary?</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Understanding semantic markup as grammar sets one up to understand its
        importance. Good grammar, as in good semantic markup, means that the
        meaning of text and the language used to produce that text (HTML) is
        less likely to be misunderstood by any other person or program, or even
        yourself, when engaging with that text. It also means that other
        processes, such as ones search engines use or the process a writer will
        undergo when using CSS, are much easier to perform and execute. Search
        engines like Google require good semantic markup in order to position
        the web page, in the ocean we call internet, correctly. This is a
        achieved through markup's ability to optimise the importance of certain
        elements of text - such as a heading versus a paragraph. This also means
        that the code is accessible to applications and can be used in the
        correct way - a good example of this is Google Calendar's ability to use
        the information from emails or other sites to create detailed events in
        your calendar. Using the correct tags in the HMTL document means that
        styling with CSS is a much more ordered and easier process. Code with
        good semantic markup also means that any changes made to the the text
        can be done so without destabilising the flow and structure of the
        document.
